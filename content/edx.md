# Urgent: edX Policy Change

edX recently announced they will remove access to course Problem Sets for **audit students who enroll after Sunday, Dec. 16**:

> edX is making some changes to what features are available to Audit Track (free) students and what features are only available to Verified Certificate Track (paid) students. The biggest change here is that only ungraded work will be available to Audit students. 

> ...

> So, we will be modifying the CS1301x courses to make Exercises (the problems between videos in the chapters) ungraded, so that Audit learners will retain access to them. Under these new edX policies, Audit learners will continue to have the Exercises, while Problem Sets will become available only to Verified Certificate students.

> ...

> These changes will only affect learners who enroll in a course on Monday, December 17th or later.


### For anyone auditing, it is imperative you *sign up* for courses by end of day Sunday.
