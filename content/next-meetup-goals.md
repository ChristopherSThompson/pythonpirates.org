# Goals for Oct 15th

We're starting a series of Python courses on [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/learning-paths/Developer/become-a-python-developer)!  
Learning path: _Become a Python Developer_

This will be an orientation meetup to introduce the learning path courses and discuss how we plan to proceed through the content.  Feel free to glance over the courses ahead of time.

Access to Lynda.com is available for free through local library memberships:

  * [Multnomah county library](https://multcolib.org/resource/lyndacom)
  * [Washington county library](https://www.wccls.org/research/lyndacom)
