# Goals for Dec. 3rd

We're progressing through a series of Python courses on [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/learning-paths/Developer/become-a-python-developer).  
Learning path: _Become a Python Developer_

Our focus on Python fundamentals continues (along with taking the courses a bit out of order).

  * Watch **course 4** in the series: _Python Essential Training_ 
  * You can skip the final section on databases; we will cover that topic at a later time.
  * This is a 4-hour course, so we will likely review the material over a span of 2 meetups.  Don't worry if you aren't able to finish. 
  * Don't be shy about asking questions in Slack: {{< slackjoinrequest >}}

Access to Lynda.com is available for free through local library memberships:

  * [Multnomah county library](https://multcolib.org/resource/lyndacom)
  * [Washington county library](https://www.wccls.org/research/lyndacom)
  * [Vancouver regional library](http://www.fvrl.org/resource/lyndacom)
