# Goals for Feb. 25

We're progressing through a series of Python courses on [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/learning-paths/Developer/become-a-python-developer).  
Learning path: _Become a Python Developer_

Our focus on Python fundamentals continues (along with taking the courses a bit out of order).

  * Watch **course 2** in the series: _Programming Foundations: Object-Oriented Design_
  * You can skip **Section 5: Class Diagrams**
  * Don't be shy about asking questions in Slack: {{< slackjoinrequest >}}

Access to Lynda.com is available for free through local library memberships:

  * [Multnomah county library](https://multcolib.org/resource/lyndacom)
  * [Washington county library](https://www.wccls.org/research/lyndacom)
  * [Vancouver regional library](http://www.fvrl.org/resource/lyndacom)
