# Goals for Nov. 12th

We're progressing through a series of Python courses on [Lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/learning-paths/Developer/become-a-python-developer).  
Learning path: _Become a Python Developer_

This week we're taking the next course a bit out of order to give folks more exposure to Python fundamentals.

  * Watch **course 3** in the series: _Learning Python_  
    Make it as far as you can, but it's okay if you don't finish
  * Work through examples using [pythontutor.com](http://www.pythontutor.com) for easier visualization
  * Don't be shy about asking questions in Slack: {{< slackjoinrequest >}}

Access to Lynda.com is available for free through local library memberships:

  * [Multnomah county library](https://multcolib.org/resource/lyndacom)
  * [Washington county library](https://www.wccls.org/research/lyndacom)
  * [Vancouver regional library](http://www.fvrl.org/resource/lyndacom)
