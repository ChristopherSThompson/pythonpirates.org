# Welcome!

There are a few steps you will need to take in order to participate with the group:

  1. If you haven't already done so, sign up with our {{< meetuplink "Meetup group" >}}
  2. Join our Slack group: {{< slackjoinrequest >}}  
    _Note: the auto-invitation can be flaky; if the above doesn't work you can ask any member to send you an invitation at the next meetup._
  3. Sign up for an account with your local library so you can access Lynda.com.  
     Search for the **learning path** _Become a Python Developer_.  
       We are currently studying: {{< courselink >}}
