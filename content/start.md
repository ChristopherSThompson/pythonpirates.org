# Welcome!

There are a few steps you will need to take in order to participate with the group:

  1. If you haven't already done so, sign up with our {{< meetuplink "Meetup group" >}}
  2. Join our Slack group: {{< slackjoinrequest >}}  
    _Note: the auto-invitation can be flaky; if the above doesn't work you can ask any member to send you an invitation at the next Meetup._
  3. Sign up for an account on [Edx.org](https://edx.org/).  
    You can also register for the current course: {{< courselink >}}
  4. **Optional:** Sign up for an account on [GitHub](https://www.github.com).
