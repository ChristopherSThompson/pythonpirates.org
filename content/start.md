# Welcome!

There are a few steps you will need to take in order to participate with the group:

  1. Join our {{< meetuplink "Meetup group" >}}, if you haven't already done so.
  1. Join our Slack group: {{< slackjoinrequest >}}  
    _Note: the auto-invitation can be flaky; if the above doesn't work you can ask any member to send you an invitation at the next meetup._
  1. Optionally, sign up for an account on [GitHub](https://www.github.com).
  1. In the past we have worked through course material on Lynda.com.  
     You can sign up for a free account through your local library.
