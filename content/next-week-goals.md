# Goals for June 11th

We're switching gears, putting CS50W on the back burner for the next few weeks, and instead focusing on a group review of the **Flask Mega Tutorial** by Miguel Grinberg.  

  * Work through the first three parts of the tutorial
    * [part 1: hello world](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
    * [part 2: templates](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-ii-templates)
    * [part 3: web forms](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iii-web-forms)
