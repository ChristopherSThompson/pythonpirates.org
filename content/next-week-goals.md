# Goals for July 16th

Keep working on the **Flask Mega Tutorial** by Miguel Grinberg!

  * Work through Chapters 8 and 9 of the tutorial:
    * [Part 8: Followers](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-viii-followers)
    * [Part 9: Pagination](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-ix-pagination)

  * Consider what would be most helpful for you for the future of the meetup. Do you want to finish the Mega-Tutorial? Go back to the Harvard course? Take a break? Discuss on [Slack](https://pythonpirates.slack.com/messages/CKAKZEUUD/convo/CCK9B5HB5-1558272354.047800/)!
