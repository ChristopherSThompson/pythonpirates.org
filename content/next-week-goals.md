# **Goals for Tuesday the 28th:** #
---
<!-- UL -->
  * Keep an eye out on [Slack](https://pythonpirates.slack.com/) for a coding challenge from Aaron.
    * [Repo link for the CRUD challenge](https://github.com/PDXPythonPirates/basic-crud-postgres-python)
    * Clues to think about:
      * "How do you delete active passengers from a flight?"
      * "How does one use Batch-Update and Batch-Insert?"
  * Keep working on Project 1...
    * Tentatively, try to finish it in the next 2 weeks? If 2 weeks is too little time, or too much, mention your thoughts on Slack.
    *  [Project 1 details](https://docs.cs50.net/web/2018/x/projects/1/project1.html)
    * Use [Flask Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) or [Corey Schafer's Youtube Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo) to help you fill in the blanks and supplement the Harvard lectures.
  * Watch Lecture 4 this week, or next week.
    * [Lecture 4 on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24Kf3v7kZyE)
