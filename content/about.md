# About Portland Python Pirates

We are a group of aspiring [pythonistas](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pythonista) helping each other learn the [Python](https://www.python.org/) language through free and inexpensive online resources.

Our group meets regularly on a (mostly) weekly basis.
Anyone located in the Portland Oregon area is welcome to attend our {{< meetuplink >}}.

You can also find us in our Slack group, {{< slacklink >}}.

All skill levels are welcome.

We are currently studying course material from {{< courselink >}}.
