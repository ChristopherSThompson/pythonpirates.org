# Skill Up with ~~Python~~ Java

Have you tried starting an online **Java** course but ended up stopping halfway through? 

Join us as we support each other in our quest to become better **Java** programmers!

We use free online courses and meet once a week to discuss problem sets and answer questions relating to Java.

We are currently studying course material from {{< courselink >}}.

See the [Getting Started page]({{< ref "/start.md" >}}) for information on joining our Meetup and Slack group.
