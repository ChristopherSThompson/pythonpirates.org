# Helping Each Other Skill Up with Python

> COVID has put a whammy on our regular meetup schedule, though we do try to meet occasionally online.  We continue to use Meetup.com to schedule the virtual meetups.
>
> We recently started a six part demo series where we will show you how you can develop and launch your Python app on Google Cloud Platform.
> This is a great opportunity to see an end-to-end Python project and dip your toes into the GCP waters. Come join us just to watch or get yourself some Qwiklabs credits and follow along.

Have you tried starting an online Python course but ended up stopping halfway through? 

Join us as we support each other in our quest to become better Python programmers!  We use free online courses and meet once a week to discuss problem sets and answer questions relating to Python.

See the [Getting Started page]({{< ref "/start.md" >}}) for information on joining our Meetup and Slack group.
